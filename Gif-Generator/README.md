### The Details

**API Parameters** - The project uses the query, rating and limit parameters from the Giphy API 

**Logistics** - When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If clicked again, it will stop playing. The user can also add their own tv shows to the button list by using the input form.
